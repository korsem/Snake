Snake game has the basic snake game logic, only instead of an apple there is a croissant ;) (because who doesn't like a good croissant? Snake for sure does). </br> Addictionally, there is a boost in the shape of coffee. After coffee snake moves faster for 10 seconds.

# ideas
Snake's design and adding background sound / music. </br> There could be also scoring system changed with an addictional boosts.
