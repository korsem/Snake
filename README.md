# Snake
Snake game in Python using pygame.

*project still in progress*

I felt a great need to write a Snake game in Python so I wrote it

I used this tutorial to teach myself basics of Pycharm and implement basic logic of a Snake game:

# to be done
Now I am working on the game display (Visible score, design for snake and adding background sound / music).
Moreover, I added a boost to the game so when Snake "eats" it (drink because boost is a cup of coffee) snake moves faster for 10 seconds.
I am thinking about adding more boosts and I this README file is still to be edited.
